In my last post I told myself "not to overdo" it. Sadly exactly this
happened. I have lots of trouble with [shin
splints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_splints) (medial). :(

## What happened?

The last long run, which went well was on 19th August. Previously I was
running over 30km multiple times on the weekend. Obviously this was too
much. I ended up with painful shin splints in both legs. Normally these
are a result of overstress.

Due to the pain in both legs I could not continue with my training plan.
In the beginning after the pain occurred for the first time, I was trying
to continue with shorter trainings. At some point I had to stop the
running at all.

Of course I went to a doctor, got physical therapy and insoles.
Meanwhile I do not have pain during normal walks and while climbing stairs
like I had in the beginning. But after having a slow first training
yesterday, again I had to suffer from pain in the well known spots in
both legs.

## How to deal with it?

Having some free time due to lack of training, I could rethink my
training plan, analyze my running style and adjust my goals.

First thing was to realize that my old training plan was not
sustainable. There were too many long runs over 30km on the weekends.
Cross checking my plan with those suggested by [Herbert
Stefny](http://www.herbertsteffny.de/), I
conclude that they would not have been necessary.

Furthermore the goal to do the first marathon in under 4h maybe was too
much. Although I did not train a lot for speed, this goal probably
contributed to having an exaggerated training schedule which did not fit
to my physical situation.

While getting the insoles and talking to the very nice people at [long
distance](http://www.longdistance.de/) in Berlin, I was introduced to ways how to improve my running
style. Paying attention to this during the runs was more easy than I
thought in the first place. Slightly twisting my right foot and placing
my feet besides each other instead of in a row helped a lot to reduce
the pain.

Also I got some information about barefoot running and I will try it out
to see if it strengthens my feet to lead to a more natural and healthy running
style.

Finally I had to readjust my goals. I would love to run the marathon in
Frankfurt. Reasonably without having a finishing time in mind now. Just
being able to finish it at all would be great. Considering all the pain
and how long lasting this seems to be, it's hard to guess if I can
manage to do so. Apparently the best thing to do right now, is pausing
the training. Every athlete will understand, this does not feel like a
good preparation for a competition.  If I cannot make it to the race in
 Frankfurt in about one month: There are other marathons!

So my new goal is to become healthy again, first of
all. After that I will watch out for a nice marathon. If this happens
early enough for Frankfurt, that's fine. Otherwise it probably will be
an event in 2013, so I can recover and train sustainably over the winter
months.

## Data
Here is the data I already had in the previous posts. No great news
though:

### Maximum Run Distance
![Longest Distance](/assets/images/first_marathon_resume_chart_distance_3.png)

I was not able to do long runs anymore. One run over 18km, which was
okay. Purposely I did not run a longer distance there to allow my legs
to recover, which did not happen. Running something like 30km would not be
possible at the moment.

### Average Pace
![Pace](/assets/images/first_marathon_resume_chart_pace_3.png)

This does not tell us too much, as the last run is only around 18km.
Still would have been to slow to finish a marathon in less than four
hours.

### Weight

Reduced training and too much intake of sweets lead to predictable
results here.


## Conclusion

It may sound stupid, but I did realize a marathon is not a walk in the
park. I expected it to be a mental challenge mostly but my body proofed
the opposite. My initial training plan did not match my physical
condition and thus was not sustainable and lead to injury.

From now on, I will be more cautious when raising training intensity and
volume. Also I am quite aware now, how bad shin splints can become and
will stop training immediately if they occur again.

Having learned these things I feel more prepared than ever to take the
challenge of training for and running a marathon. This will be even more
valuable for upcoming future goals: Let's go Ultra! :)
