About two month ago I did sign up for my first marathon and started to
focus my training for that event. In my [previous
post](/first-marathon-resume-after-one-month-of-training) I defined a
simple way to measure my progress towards the goal, running the marathon
distance.

Another month has passed and here is my updated report. It was not a
great month for training, as we did move to Berlin and a had a bad cold
for almost 2 weeks. Both things did collide with my training schedule.
But let's have a closer look at the state of affairs:

### Maximum Run Distance

This still looks good, doesn't it? Well, there is a thing you don't see here:
The last run over 33km I did have to walk some parts in last quarter.
Not only was it my first run after 2 weeks with a cold, but additionally
it was quite hot (~32Â°C). First half of that run was quite good, though.
Also you can recognize the missing long runs.

### Average Pace

Now it's obvious the last run, was not that good, right? ;)

However I did a test, if I would be able to do a long run in under 5.75
min/km on July 14th. This did work very well. Of course it was not 42.195km, but only
30.5km, but still I am happy with that result. It was quite exhausting,
though. That's why I will do the long run with slower pace while
extending the distance.

### Weight

I was able to reduce my wight slightly. I did the [slow carb
diet](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise/),
because I had very good results with that when reducing weight for a
[Sambo
Competition](http://www.ddk-ev.de/startseite/news/564-ergebnisse-qoffene-deutsche-ddk-budo-meisterschaftq.html).
 This time it did not work as well.

I will skip the diet I guess. It's very monotonous and was not effective
this time. Reducing the intake of carbohydrates might not be a good idea
for long distance endurance training. Also it definitely is an
additional stress factor. I will return to a normal, healthy diet and keep an eye on my weight.

## Conclusion
I am still on track! Due to the move and my illness, I am not as far as
I wanted to be. The last run actually was too hard. I have to be
cautious not to overdo it now, but return to a well structured and
reasonable training schedule. Doing that, I have no doubt to finish the
marathon.

Expect my next update in about a month. Maybe that will be the last one
before the event on 28th of October. Wish me well!
