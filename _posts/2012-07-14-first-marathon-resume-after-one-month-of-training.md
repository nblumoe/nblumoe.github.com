Roughly one month ago I did sign up for my first marathon. At that time
I also wrote a [post about how I will prepare][first-post] for that. So
let's have fun and create some additional pressure by publishing the
results so far.

[first-post]: /project-42195-training-for-the-first-marathon/

## How to measure progress
The main goal is to be able to run the marathon distance. That's why
*maximum run distance* is of major importance. Secondly I want to finish
in under 4 hours. This means a pace of under 5.7 min/km (btw. I really
dislike using this unit, but it's just so common for running). So I am
having an eye on the *average pace* of the longest run.

Although I pointed out in the first post, that *reducing weight* is not a
serious goal. This changed somehow: Instead of loosing some weight or at
least having it constant, I did gain some weight. That's just not
acceptable! ;)
So from now on, reducing weight to 76 kg is officially a part of the
things to achieve till the 28th October.

## State of Affairs

### Maximum Run Distance

I am doing quite well here. From the chart above it is obvious: There's
nothing to worry about here. The longest run so far has been 28.1 km and
the progression is good. I have to keep up the good work here.

### Average Pace

As it turns out, reaching the goal to finish the first marathon in under
4 hours, might be harder than expected. The chart clearly shows a tendency to
run slower with increasing run distance. Of course that's just natural,
but I have to keep pushing my speed to reach the goal. This might become
tough.

### Weight
![Weight](/assets/images/first_marathon_resume_chart_weight.png)

The data here is rather rough. These are not mean weights, but my weight
on the day of the training. My weight has a natural, daily fluctuation of
around +/- 1kg. However, my body weight did increase and I would like to
reduce it for the marathon. This should also help in increasing the pace.

## Conclusion

I am very confident, that I will not have big issues with reaching the
marathon distance within time. However it's being said, that the
difficulties start at >30 km. I am quite curious, I have to admit.

Besides that, I want to get faster and reduce weight. I will keep an eye
on my pace on the long runs and try to keep it under 6 min/km at least.
Regarding the weight loss: I will reduce carbohydrates in favor of
protein. Furthermore I am going to fulfill my promise from the first
post: I will skip sweets! ;)

I am looking forward to the upcoming training and I will keep you
posted. By the way, I am tracking my trainings with Endomondo, so feel
free to join me on the [Endomondo Community][endomondo].
