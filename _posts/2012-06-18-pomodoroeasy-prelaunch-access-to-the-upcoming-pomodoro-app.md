If you stumbled across my article series [about how to build a
webapp][howto-webapp], you already know: I am working on an app to bring
the awesome [Pomodoro Technique][1] to life on your machines.

The Pomodoro Technique is a great, hassle free way to boost you
productivity. The main goal is to focus on your tasks and to prevent
interruptions.
There is no app out there, which has everything you need to use the
technique. So if you are interested in the Pomorodo Technique, checkout
[PomodoroEasy] and sign up for pre-launch access. I am happy to get your
feedback for this!

[<img src="/assets/images/PomodoroEasy_free_timer.png" alt="PomodoroEasy
Free Pomodoro Timer" title="Free Pomodoro Timer" class="right">][free-timer]

After signing up, you get redirected immediately to the free pomodoro
timer I am providing there. Of course it is also available without
signing up. So at least check out the [free pomodoro timer][free-timer].

There is still some stuff to do on the app before I can send out invites
to the pre-launch. But make sure to enjoy and work with the free timer
till then.  Oh, and the launch page needs some rework... I do know! ;)

Any kind of feedback is heartly appreciated.
