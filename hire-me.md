how to solve your problems!

## Who I am
So you prefer to read on? That's just fine. Let me brefly introduce myself a
little more: I was born in 1982 and literally grew up with computers and
programming. Coding has been my passion since then and I did get a lot
of experience in different languages and projects. I did study Physics
and Geoscience and am close to finishing my PhD-Thesis. I always loved
how useful my programming skills were during that time. However, I
decided to be a full time programmer. Just too often I had to deal with
bad software, which really annoyed me. As I love software development so
much, this is what I want to do: Deliver great Software!

Besides getting your coding needs done, I will also help to analyze
