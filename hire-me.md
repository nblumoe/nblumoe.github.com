I am a web and mobile developer, based in Berlin. Being very

just send me an [eMail](mailto:nils@blum-oeste.de) or call me
[+49 157 8590 4890](tel:+4915785904890). Let's just meet and figure out
how to solve your problems!

## Why you may want me
So you prefer to read on? That's just fine. Let me briefly introduce myself a
little more: I was born in 1982 and literally grew up with computers and
programming. Coding has been my passion since then and I did get a lot
of experience in different languages and projects.

I did study Physics
and Geoscience and am close to finishing my PhD-Thesis. I always loved
how useful my programming skills were during that time. However, I
decided to be a full time software developer. Just too often I had to deal with
bad software, which really annoyed me. As I love software development so
much, this is what I want to do: Deliver great Software!

Until 2008 I mostly developed desktop software. Today I
focus on state of the art web and mobile technologies and their combination.
I did work in startups and love the scene.

Throughout all the different projects I have been involved in, I did
realize how crucial the underlying processes are. To get a great product
done, it is not enough to have good coders. It is very important to have
a processes and control to deliver in time. Using lean methodologies, we
get a feedback loop which ensures you really build what your customers
want. Agility ensures focus, productivity and flexibility of your
development team.

Besides getting your coding needs done, I will help you with getting
your software architecture right. Furthermore we can improve your development
process together by introducing well structured, lean and agile
techniques.
